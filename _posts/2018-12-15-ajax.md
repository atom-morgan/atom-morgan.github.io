## Introduction

In this tutorial we'll be building off of the previous tutorial updating our form to make our first HTTP request.

Everything up to this point has been relatively "static". We've been working on the client side of the web (refer back to the "Client Server Model" section in [Code Companion #1](http://atom-morgan.github.io/what-is-web-development/){:target="_blank"} if necessary). All of the data in our previous tutorials was either hard-coded or provided by user inputs. We now want to bring in the server side of the client server model by interacting with an API.

The HTTP request we'll create will be made to the [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/){:target="_blank"} to retrieve additional details about the Pokemon that was entered into the form. We'll then extract the image of the Pokemon from these details and add it to the DOM.

This HTTP request will be made using AJAX which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. One of the primary characteristics of AJAX is its asynchronous nature, meaning we will be able to make an HTTP request for the Pokemon image, receive the response from [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/){:target="_blank"}, and update the page without the user having to refresh the page.

## Setup

Since we'll be building off of our previous code we're going to start by "cloning" or copying your code from GitHub assuming you pushed it to GitHub at the end of the tutorial.

First, find the URL for your repository by navigating to your repository page and clicking the green "Clone or download" button.

![Repository git url](/images/ajax/git-clone.png)

Then you can clone your project with the following command updating the URL to your own Git repository. This gives us a copy of our old code so that we can make add new features while leaving our `forms` project intact.

```console
git clone https://github.com/adammorganshow/forms.git ajax
```

The `ajax` at the end specifies the directory name to place this project into saving us the steps of `mkdir ajax` and `cd ajax`.

> If you didn't push your project to GitHub and you don't have your old code from Code Companion #10, feel free to use my repository which is listed in the `git clone` command above.

## Update addToPokedex

The first thing we'll want to do is update our previous unordered list to a `div`.

```html
<div id="pokemon-list"></div>
```

In the previous tutorial, we were simply adding the names of each Pokemon to the DOM which is a great use for an unordered list. But going forward, we're going to have more details for each Pokemon and an unordered list is a bit too simplistic for our needs. Now our new `div` with the id `pokemon-list` will serve as the container for the Pokemon that are submitted using the form.

Since we've updated the `ul` to a `div`, we'll also need to make a few small edits to our `addToPokedex` function.

First, we'll remove the variable declaration and initialization for `listItem` which created a new `li` element for our unordered list which we just updated to a `div`. We'll also remove the last two lines of our function which set the `innerHTML` of `listItem` and appended it to `pokemon-list`.

At this point your `addToPokedex` function should look like this:

```javascript
function addToPokedex(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  let name = event.target.pokemon.value;
  let description = event.target.description.value;

  let list = document.getElementById('pokemon-list');
}
```

Now we want to update this function to add the `name` and `description` back to `pokemon-list` with an updated HTML structure.

To do this, we'll be creating a container (`div`) for each Pokemon with a `p` inside of it containing the Pokemon's name and description. Then, we'll add this container to `pokemon-list`. (Later on in this tutorial, we'll also add the Pokemon image to this container (`div`)).

```javascript
function addToPokedex(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  let name = event.target.pokemon.value;
  let description = event.target.description.value;

  let pokemonContainer = document.createElement('div');
  pokemonContainer.id = name.toLowerCase();
  let pokemonContent = document.createElement('p');
  pokemonContent.innerHTML = `${name} - ${description}`;
  pokemonContainer.appendChild(pokemonContent);

  let list = document.getElementById('pokemon-list');
  list.appendChild(pokemonContainer);
}
```

First we create a new `div` element and set it to the `pokemonContainer` variable. Then we set the `id` of that `div` to the name of the Pokemon entered into the form using the `.toLowerCase()` method to lowercase the name (it's common convention to avoid uppercase letters in CSS ids and classes).

Then we create a `p` element, set it to the `pokemonContent` variable, and set its `innerHTML` to a template literal string containing the Pokemon's name and description.

Now that our two elements have been created we then add `pokemonContent` to `pokemonContainer` using `.appendChild()`. Finally, we add `pokemonContainer` to `pokemon-list` leveraging our local DOM object `list`.

At this point you can go back to your browser, refresh, and verify everything is still working. The only difference will be the styling. Since we're no longer using an unordered list, there won't be bullets for each Pokemon entered—they're now `p` tags.

## Anatomy of Ajax

Now that we've updated our HTML for our new structure with the appropriate changes in `addToPokedex` we can move on to AJAX which we'll be using to make HTTP requests.

Let's take a look at AJAX requests breaking it down into the various pieces which serve as the anatomy of an AJAX request.

### XMLHttpRequest

To make an AJAX request we'll be leveraging [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest){:target="_blank"} to create an XMLHttpRequest, or XHR, object. A simple example of this is shown below.

```javascript
let httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
```

Similar to other [constructor functions](http://atom-morgan.github.io/object-oriented-javascript/){:target="_blank"} such as `Date`, we create this object using the `new` keyword setting it to a variable that we can interact with. 

### Response handler

Once we make a request using our new XHR object, we'll eventually receive a response. To handle this response we'll be using the `onreadystatechange` property.

```javascript
let httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();

httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function() {
  // Process the response here
};
```

As you can see, we set the `onreadystatechange` property to a function. Within that function is where we write our code to process the response we receive from our HTTP request.

### Request options

At this point we've declared what happens when we receive a response from our request but now we need to actually make our request.

First, we initialize our request using the `.open()` method.

```javascript
let httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
httpRequest.open('GET', 'http://someurl.com');

httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function() {
  // Process the response here
};
```

The `open` method takes two parameters: the HTTP request method and the URL to send the request to.

In the above example we've provided the request method `GET` which simply retrieves data from the requested resource our URL. In our case, the URL is a made up URL, `http://someurl.com`. (We'll get to our Pokeapi example shortly.)

> There are other HTTP request methods such as PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE which you can read about [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods){:target="_blank"}. We'll take a closer look at those in future tutorials. For now, we'll be working with GET since it's the simplest one of them all and usually the first HTTP request you create in your career as a web developer.

Now that we've specified our request method and the URL for our request, we can make the request using the `.send()` method.

```javascript
let httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
httpRequest.open('GET', 'http://someurl.com');
httpRequest.send();

httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function() {
  // Process the response here
};
```

This is the basic structure of AJAX requests.

1. Create an XHR object using `XMLHttpRequest`
2. Create a response handler using `onreadystatechange`
3. Specify the request method and URL using `.open()`
4. Make the request using `.send()`

## Fetch Pokemon (AJAX)

Now that we've seen how to create AJAX requests, we can work towards creating one for our request to Pokeapi. We'll be creating a separate function for this request so let's start by outlining our requirements for this functionality.

### Requirements

1. Create a new `fetchPokemon` function
2. Call our new `fetchPokemon` function in the form submit event handler
3. Get the Pokemon name from the the function parameter which will be passed in from the form submit event handler
4. Setup the AJAX request
5. Setup the response handler

We'll begin with requirement #1 by creating our new function.

```javascript
function fetchPokemon(event) {
}
```

With our new function defined, we can now call our new function to fulfill requirement #2.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  let form = document.getElementById('pokedex');
  form.addEventListener('submit', function() {
    addToPokedex(event);
    fetchPokemon(event);
  });
});
```

Now that our function is called with the `event` object as an argument, we can extract the Pokemon name from it in `fetchPokemon` function for requirement #3.

```javascript
function fetchPokemon(event) {
  let pokemon = event.target.pokemon.value.toLowerCase();
}
```

We now have the Pokemon name in our `fetchPokemon` function. Now we can setup our AJAX request for requirement #4.

```javascript
function fetchPokemon(event) {
  let pokemon = event.target.pokemon.value.toLowerCase();

  let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  let url = `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemon}/`;
  request.open('GET', url);
  request.send();
}
```

First we create our XHR object. Then we create a `url` variable set to a template literal string of the Pokeapi endpoint which contains the `pokemon` variable we created earlier.

<!--More details about endpoints-->
<!--https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html#pokemon-->

We then use `.open()` to specify our request method, `GET`, and the URL using our `url` variable. Finally, we call `.send()`.

Now we can move on to requirement #5 by setting up our response handler.

```javascript
function fetchPokemon(event) {
  let pokemon = event.target.pokemon.value.toLowerCase();

  let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
  let url = `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemon}/`;
  request.open('GET', url);
  request.send();

  request.onreadystatechange = function() {
    // Handle response here
  };
}
```

## Add Pokemon image to DOM

At this point we're now ready to implement the functionality within our response handler. Once again, we'll break this down into a series of requirements working towards our final goal of adding the Pokemon image from the response to the DOM.

### Requirements

1. Verify the server response was received
2. Check the response status code of the HTTP response
3. Handle any errors
4. Parse the response
5. Get the image from AJAX response
6. Get the pokemon name from AJAX response
7. Create the image element
8. Add image to DOM

To start we'll address requirement #1, verifying the response was received. To do this we'll be checking the `readyState` property of our XHR object as follows.

> Since the remainder of this code is handling the HTTP response within `onreadystatechange`, I'll be omitting the rest of the code to keep the code blocks as small as possible.

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    // Request is finished. Response is ready!
  }
};
```

Here we check that `request.readyState` is equal to `4` which means that the request has completed.

> You can read about the other `readyState` values [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started#Step_2_%E2%80%93_Handling_the_server_response){:target="_blank"}.

Now that we have our conditional for a completed request, we can now check the status code of our response, a success or an error, which will address requirement #2.

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      // Good to go!
    } else {
      // There was a problem.
    }
  }
};
```

Here we check for a successful response code using the `status` property. If it's a `200` or `OK` response code, we've received a [successful response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#Successful_responses){:target="_blank"}. Otherwise, there was an issue which we can address in our `else` statement.

For now, we'll simply write a message to the console if we receive any errors to address requirement #3.

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      // Good to go!
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};
```

Now we can move on to requirement #4, parsing the response from our HTTP request.

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      let response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
      // Add Pokemon image to DOM
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};
```

Here we use `JSON.parse()` to parse the response from our request in the form of `request.responseText` which, according to the documentation for `responseText`, "contains the response to the request as text". Wrapping that with `JSON.parse()` converts it to a JavaScript object that we set to `response`.

> These properties are all listed within the documentation for [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#Properties){:target="_blank"} under the properties section. Over time, you may memorize some of these but when you're just starting out it's helpful to have documentation open so you know the various properties and methods that are exposed to you.

Now that we have a response object we can interact with, we can begin to get the bits of data we need to add this to the DOM.

First, we'll get the image path and Pokemon name to address requirements #5 and #6.

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      let response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);

      let path = response.sprites.front_default;
      let name = response.name;
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};
```

Now we can create our `img` tag setting its `src` and `alt` attributes to address requirement #7.

<!--(alt tag - SEO and accessibility)-->

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      let response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);

      let path = response.sprites.front_default;
      let name = response.name;

      let image = document.createElement('img');
      image.src = path;
      image.alt = name;
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};
```

Finally, we can add our new `image` object to the DOM to fulfill our last requirement.

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      let response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);

      let path = response.sprites.front_default;
      let name = response.name;

      let image = document.createElement('img');
      image.src = path;
      image.alt = name;

      let pokemonListItem = document.getElementById(name.toLowerCase());
      pokemonListItem.appendChild(image);      
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};
```

At this point, you can refresh your browser, complete the form, and you should see the Pokemon image and description added to the DOM.

To clean up our code a bit, we'll move all of the functionality related to creating the Pokemon `img` element into its own function.

```javascript
function placePokemonImage(pokemonData) {
  let path = pokemonData.sprites.front_default;
  let name = pokemonData.name;

  let image = document.createElement('img');
  image.src = path;
  image.alt = name;

  let pokemonListItem = document.getElementById(name.toLowerCase());
  pokemonListItem.appendChild(image); 
}
```

Note the updated reference to `pokemonData` instead of `response` to match our function's parameter name.

Now we can update our request handler by removing all of the old code to call our `placePokemonImage` function instead.

```javascript
request.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (request.readyState === 4) {
    if (request.status === 200) {
      let response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
      placePokemonImage(response);     
    } else {
      console.log('There was a problem with the request.');
    }
  }
};

function placePokemonImage(pokemonData) {
  let path = pokemonData.sprites.front_default;
  let name = pokemonData.name;

  let image = document.createElement('img');
  image.src = path;
  image.alt = name;

  let pokemonListItem = document.getElementById(name.toLowerCase());
  pokemonListItem.appendChild(image); 
}
```

## Add loading message

Now that we have added the Pokemon data and image to the DOM, we'll finish by improving the UX of the form by adding a loading message as the request is being made since it can take a few seconds to complete at times.

First, we'll create a new function for creating our loading indicator.

```javascript
function createLoadingIndicator() {
  let loading = document.createElement('p')
  loading.id = 'loading';
  loading.innerHTML = 'Loading...';
  return loading;
}
```

Note how our function returns the `loading` object rather than adding it to the DOM directly.

Now we can call this function and add the loading indicator to the DOM within our `addToPokedex` function.

```javascript
function addToPokedex(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  let name = event.target.pokemon.value;
  let description = event.target.description.value;

  let pokemonContainer = document.createElement('div');
  pokemonContainer.id = name.toLowerCase();
  let pokemonContent = document.createElement('p');
  pokemonContent.innerHTML = `${name} - ${description}`;
  pokemonContainer.appendChild(pokemonContent);

  let list = document.getElementById('pokemon-list');
  list.appendChild(pokemonContainer);

  let loadingIndicator = createLoadingIndicator();
  pokemonContainer.appendChild(loadingIndicator);
}
```

Now when our `addToPokedex` function is called but *before* `fetchPokemon` is called, the loading indicator will be created and added to the DOM.

Refresh and submit the form again and you should notice the loading indicator is created as expected. However, once the request is completed the loading indicator remains.

To fix this, we'll need to create another function to remove this loading indicator.

## Remove loading message

First, we'll write our function to remove the indicator.

```javascript
function removeLoadingIndicator() {
  let loading = document.getElementById('loading');
  loading.remove();
}
```

Now that our function is ready to be called, we have to think about *where* to call it. We want the loading indicator to be removed once a successful request has been made and completed. A good place for this would be inside our `placePokemonImage` function which is called only when a successful response is received from our HTTP request.

```javascript
function placePokemonImage(pokemonData) {
  removeLoadingIndicator();

  let path = pokemonData.sprites.front_default;
  let name = pokemonData.name;

  let image = document.createElement('img');
  image.src = path;
  image.alt = name;

  let pokemonListItem = document.getElementById(name.toLowerCase());
  pokemonListItem.appendChild(image); 
}
```

Now when we receive a response from our HTTP request, we'll remove the loading indicator just before adding the Pokemon image to the DOM.

Refresh your browser, complete the form, and you should see the loading indicator appear briefly before being removed once the Pokemon image is added to the view.

## Conclusion

You've now learned how to make your first HTTP request using AJAX to take a user's input, send that to a server, and manage a response once it's sent back. If you're like me, doing that for the first time felt really cool.

> If you're looking for other APIs to use for development practice there's a curated list [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis){:target="_blank"}. To keep things simple on your end, look for an API where the "Auth" column says "No".

To wrap up, add your latest changes to Git.

```console
git init
git add .
```

Then add a commit message.

```console
git commit -m "Add AJAX call to form"
```

Then push these changes up to GitHub.

```console
git push origin master
```

## Exercise

For some extra practice, see if you can update the `console.log` for request errors to remove the loading indicator and add a message to the DOM for the user to try again.
