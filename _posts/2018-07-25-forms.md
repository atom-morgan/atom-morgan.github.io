## Introduction

In this tutorial we'll be building off of the previous tutorial updating our user prompt to a more familiar web UI—forms.

From here on we'll be continually adding features to this application building a full blown Pokedex.

## Setup

First we'll make a new folder for our project.

```console
mkdir forms
cd forms
```

Within this directory we'll create two new files, an HTML file and a JavaScript file similar to what we did previously in [Code Companion #9](https://atom-morgan.github.io/dom-manipulation/){:target="_blank"}.

```console
touch main.js index.html
```

{% include request-tutorial.html %}

## Form

The first thing we'll do is add our HTML, including a form, to `index.html`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Code Companion - Forms</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <form id="pokedex">
      <p>Pokemon name:</p>
      <input type="text" name="pokemon">

      <p>Description:</p>
      <textarea name="description" rows="10" cols="30"></textarea>

      <br>
      <button type="submit">Add to Pokedex</button>
    </form>

    <h2>Pokemon:</h2>

    <ul id="pokemon-list"></ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

First we begin with a `form` tag setting its `id` attribute to `pokedex`. This `id` is what we'll be using to access the values a user enters into the form.

Within the form we've added two inputs: one using the `input` tag and another using the `textarea` tag. The noteworthy parts here are the `name` attributes. The values set to `name` are what we'll use to access the specific values within the form. Finally, we have a `button` that will be used to submit the form.

Below our form we also have an unordered list which should look familiar if you worked through [Code Companion #9](https://atom-morgan.github.io/dom-manipulation/){:target="_blank"}.

## Event Listener

Now that we have our form setup we can setup an event listener for the form.

```javascript
function addToPokedex(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log('event ', event);
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  let form = document.getElementById('pokedex');
  form.addEventListener('submit', function() {
    addToPokedex(event);
  });
});
```

First we add an event listener for `DOMContentLoaded`. Within this event we add another event listener for our form. Unlike our previous example where we were listening to a `click` event, we're now waiting for the `submit` event.

Once this event has fired we call the `addToPokedex` function passing it `event` which is an object representing the event of the event listener. This object contains [multiple properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event#Properties){:target="_blank"} including a property that allows us to access the values in the form which we'll get to shortly.

Within our `addToPokedex` function we first call `event.preventDefault()` which prevents the default form event from firing. In this case, we're preventing our form from initiating a request to a backend since we don't have one. For now, we're doing everything client-side.

Open `index.html` in Chrome, add some values to the form, click submit, and you should see the `event` object logged to the console.

## Accessing form values

Now that our function has access to the event object, we can access the values within our form.

```javascript
function addToPokedex(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  let name = event.target.pokemon.value;
  let description = event.target.description.value;
  console.log(`Name is ${name}`);
  console.log(`Description is ${description}`);
}
```

To access our form object we use `event.target`. Following target are the `name` attributes we specified within our form (`pokemon` and `description`) with `.value` after each name to get the value of each input. We then log the values for `name` and `description` to verify we're getting the values we expect.

Refresh your page, complete the form again, and you should see your values printed to the console.

Now that we have the values within our form, we can create a new list element and add it to the unordered list.

```javascript
function addToPokedex(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  let name = event.target.pokemon.value;
  let description = event.target.description.value;

  let listItem = document.createElement('li');
  let list = document.getElementById('pokemon-list');

  listItem.innerHTML = `${name} - ${description}`;
  list.appendChild(listItem);
}
```

Go back to Chrome, complete the form, and you should see the list update with your Pokemon.

## Resetting the Form

Our list is now updating correctly but our form maintains its original state with the user's values within the form's inputs. Let's add an update to clear this form once the form has been submitted.

```javascript
function clearForm() {
  document.getElementById('pokedex').reset();
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  let form = document.getElementById('pokedex');
  form.addEventListener('submit', function() {
    addToPokedex(event);
    clearForm();
  });
});
```

Here we've added a `clearForm` function that uses `getElementById` to access the form. We then call `.reset()` to reset the form and call `clearForm()` within the event listener for `submit`.

Now when you submit the form the list should populate with your values and reset the form for the user.

## Conclusion

Before we finish, add your latest changes to Git.

```console
git init
git add .
```

Then add a commit message.

```console
git commit -m "Add forms"
```

Then push these changes up to GitHub.

```console
git push origin master
```

## Exercise

For some extra practice, see if you can update `main.js` to avoid adding empty list elements to the DOM if the user submits an empty form.
