  Why do investors need to be accredited?
---

I stumbled upon an article the other day that contained a small piece of information I’d never known before. To be an investor, you have to be [accredited](http://www.businessinsider.com/sec-announces-crowdfunding-rule-to-allow-startups-to-raise-1-million-from-unaccredited-investors-2013-10#ixzz2iaskUpYm){:target="_blank"}.

>Private companies are currently allowed to solicit only accredited investors - those with a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding the value of their homes, or annual income of more than $200,000.

One million dollars. That seems like a high requirement in today’s world where businesses can literally be started by a couple of students living in a dorm room.

I’ve never invested money into a company and I definitely don’t have enough cash to throw around at a few small startups, but in the early stages companies can get by with very little capital. Just recently in Atlanta, a new [fund](http://davidcummings.org/2013/09/27/announcing-the-atlanta-student-fund/){:target="_blank"} has been created specifically for students at Georgia Tech. Investments range from $5,000 to $10,000.

That’s still no small sum of money for a recent college graduate like myself, but it’s manageable for someone in my situation. And to be perfectly honest, it’s even an amount I would seriously consider investing if I saw enough potential in the founders and their business.

However, even if the crowdfunding proposal is passed, “unaccredited” investors will be extremely limited in the amount they can legally contribute.

>The proposal says that investors with a net worth and income of less than $100,000 can contribute only $2,000 or 5 percent of their net worth or income, whichever is greater.

I wouldn’t be able to provide the experience and knowledge of more seasoned investors, but it’s cash and it diverts attention away from fundraising and towards building a business. It’s cash I’m willing to risk today with the potential for a greater return tomorrow.

All of this leaves one burning question on my mind. Why do investors need to be accredited?
