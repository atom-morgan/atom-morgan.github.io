  The issue here is that Peter Thiel does not conform to the politics of the Valley and they want him out.

The political and social climate of Silicon Valley was summed up perfectly today. Investor Peter Thiel, a man who [has gay sex but isn't gay](http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/10/14/peter-thiel-shows-us-theres-difference-between-gay-sex-and-gay){:target="_blank"}, spoke at the National Press Club to defend his decision to support Donald Trump. He's the only prominent figure within tech, and industry at the forefront of diversity and inclusion, to publicly support Donald Trump and the backlash was so severe he's forced to *defend* it.

The issue here is that Peter Thiel does not conform to the politics of the Valley and they want him out. They'll even make things up to defame him.

Just Google "Peter Thiel Women" and you'll see [plenty](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/peter-thiel-women-democracy_us_5747079be4b03ede4413f6f5){:target="_blank"} [of](http://gawker.com/5231390/facebook-backer-wishes-women-couldnt-vote){:target="_blank"} [articles](https://mic.com/articles/156922/peter-thiel-facebook-donald-trump-donation-diversity-inclusion#.YM4qGv0Ry){:target="_blank"} with similar claims that Thiel is against women having the right to vote.

Here's the statement they're referring to:

> Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.

I seriously question the intelligence and integrity of journalists who read this, if they even did, and turned it into Thiel having a desire to repeal the 19th Amendment.

Substitute those two groups with any other demographic and it should be clear.

> Since 2000, the vast increase in socialists and the extension of the franchise to teenagers — two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians — have rendered the notion of “capitalist democracy” into an oxymoron.

This is nothing more than observing a trend and comparing its results to the ideal "capitalist democracy" that Thiel wish existed. Welfare beneficiaries and women could literally be any other group of people or demographic, it's simply the two that actually exist.
