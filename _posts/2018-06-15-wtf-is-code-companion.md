  What the **** is Code Companion?

Last year I quit my full-time job to write my book, [The Angular Tutorial](http://www.angulartutorial.org/){:target="_blank"}. Once that was finished and available for purchase I started looking for my next project.

Now I'm working on a **free blog and screencast series** teaching JavaScript and web development to complete beginners in programming ([screencasts here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgkEjEA23L4&list=PLsZjlbJIu0a9W8otpkC9bDKMcRb24DpbC){:target="_blank"}, [blogs here](http://atom-morgan.github.io/tutorials/){:target="_blank"}).

Thinking back on my own experiences as a beginner I remember taking a lot of time to research my sources before I started. I would ask myself questions like:

1. Who is this person?
1. Do they have a resume with credible experience and projects?
1. Do other people enjoy this person's tutorials?
1. What is their teaching style? How are they different from other teachers?
1. Are they committed to this project or will these tutorials stop coming in a month?

So to help you I'm going to answer these questions for you upfront.

### Who is this person?

I'm not your traditional Stanford CS grad who went straight to Facebook after college.

After I finished college, I was originally working in marketing consulting as a data analyst. Not even a year into that well-paying job with five weeks of paid vacation a year I quit to pursue programming with zero experience on my resume.

Now I'm a self-taught, full-stack software engineer who's been working in the industry for the past 5 years.

You can hear the full story in [this video](https://youtu.be/u6Egm0bIP7k){:target="_blank"} where I walk you through every job on my resume and provide lessons I learned along the way including **how I negotiated a job offer that doubled my salary overnight**.

### Do they have a resume with proven experience?

I'll let you decide.

I've worked with Fortune 500 companies, startups, agencies, and an angel investment firm. Here's a few names you may recognize:

* CNN
* DirecTV
* Turner Broadcasting System
* NBC
* Mazda
* Olive Garden
* The Home Depot
* AutoTrader

As far as projects go, here are two of the coolest ones I worked on.

* **Clap.VC** - Maybe the worst name ever but also the coolest project I delivered. This application allowed entrepreneurs to pitch investors remotely using real-time video and text chat. It also allowed screensharing to present pitch decks. I was the sole front-end developer who built the application using Angular. I was also the sole developer for the Chrome and Firefox extensions needed for screensharing.
* **CNNgo** - I worked with CNN and DirecTV to create the CNNgo app for DirecTV's set-top boxes (39 million subscribers). While watching TV, the application presented the user with related content such as photo galleries and streaming VOD. I was one of two developers who built the application using AngularJS.

### Do other people enjoy this person's tutorials?

Yes! I've previously written for the website [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/@adam-morgan){:target="_blank"} covering automated testing in AngularJS. In fact, the overwhelming positive feedback I received is what inspired me to write my book [The Angular Tutorial](http://www.angulartutorial.org/){:target="_blank"}.

Here's what readers have to say:

> "This book along with Adam’s advice has completely changed my career, after just a few examples I felt JavaScript suddenly “click” like never before. JS went from my most dreaded language to the only one I wanted to use and I landed my dream job because of it. I could write a book on just the benefits I have gotten from this one. If you are trying to learn JavaScript, how to architect an app, how to test, or Angular, then this book is a must have. As a React dev I can say with confidence this is the book that really taught me JavaScript." -Levi Robertson

> "Your instructions are very clear and well written. I was able to follow not only the syntax, but your thinking as well. Nice work." -Casey Burnett

> "Adam, you clearly and simply explained the things which were so difficult for me. Thanks a lot, cheers!" -Dmytro Kulikov

> "Great tutorial! One of the best articles/tutorials on the subject. Thank you for sharing your knowledge." -Bonnard Toc

### What's their teaching style? How are they different from other teachers?

For my **free, beginner-friendly material** I'm releasing content in both **written and video** form. The videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgkEjEA23L4&list=PLsZjlbJIu0a9W8otpkC9bDKMcRb24DpbC){:target="_blank"} cover the same material in the blog posts but I occasionally go into more details.

My approach to teaching programming is one that's practical and correlates to how I've worked as a software engineer for the past 5 years.

When I'm illustrating a concept, I do everything I can to give **realistic, real-world problems** that we solve with code. Programming examples with variables like "foo", "bar", and "baz" have never helped me so you **won't see them here**. That means coding samples will be **easier for you to understand and remember**. Problems can be told as stories and stories are easy to remember.

You can also join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/xMc7n3Z){:target="_blank"} where you can ask questions directly to the person who wrote the material you're reading (me!).

### Are they committed to this project or will these tutorials stop coming in a month?

As I mentioned earlier, I quit my full-time job for this last year :)

I'm now self-employed working on creating educational programming content full-time.

Since then I [published my first book](https://www.amazon.com/Angular-Tutorial-Front-End-Development-Automated/dp/1980891419/ref=la_B07CMC6CL8_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1529067875&sr=1-1){:target="_blank"} (500 pages!) teaching front-end development and automated testing using Angular and Cypress. It's a full course that teaches you how to build, test, and deploy an Angular application from scratch.

Now I've decided to move on to **free, beginner friendly content** for people who aren't quite ready for a book like [The Angular Tutorial](http://www.angulartutorial.org/){:target="_blank"}. Check out the Code Companion series [here](http://atom-morgan.github.io/tutorials/){:target="_blank"}.
