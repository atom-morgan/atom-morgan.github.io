Shortly after Angular's release, I took time off day-to-day work to focus on writing a book.

I self-published a 500+ page book teaching the Angular framework and automated testing. The book teaches how to create, develop, test, and deploy Angular applications using the Angular CLI, Jasmine, and Cypress.

It is currently the highest rated book on Amazon covering Angular and automated testing and the feedback from readers has been very positive.

If you're interested in learning more about Angular, automated testing, or hiring me for Angular workshops, feel free to contact me via email at [atom.morgan@gmail.com](mailto:atom.morgan@gmail.com){:target="_blank"} or [click here](https://calendly.com/atom-morgan){:target="_blank"} to set up a call.
