Working with Shocase Sports, Adidas, and Rivals, I built an Angular 6 application to allow high school athletes to upload photos and videos to aid college scouts in recruiting efforts. Athletes were also provided the ability to enter regional challenges with a fan ranking system for user interactivity.

In anticipation of reusing the application for other industries, I built an internal library to customize and generate multi-step user registration forms.
