I"†<p>I was recently listening to David Choe on The Joe Rogan Experience. Heâ€™s the guy who made millions painting Facebookâ€™s office, way before they were big, in exchange for stock.</p>

<p>Long story short, they were talking about art teachers they had in school and how they completely killed their motivation to pursue art both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>I started thinking about art teachers I had growing up and I feel the exact same way.</p>

<p>Almost all of my art teachers were the fucking worst.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not just that they were bad at teaching artâ€¦I have some thoughts on that.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s that they seemed like miserable people. Kids have an interest in their craft that they teach every single day and they didnâ€™t care to cultivate that one bit.</p>

<p>Is it as simple as theyâ€™re miserable because they didnâ€™t â€œmake itâ€? They expected to achieve something more with art and now theyâ€™re teaching 3rd graders?</p>

<p>Art is about as free from constraints as you can get. Sometimes that leads to modern art which objectively sucks. But sometimes that leads to amazing art I see every day on Instagram.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to get a miserable person to change their ways. But in general, the entire approach to teaching art is completely wrong.</p>

<p>If a kid spends all of their creative time drawing Iron Man and The Hulk, why are they learning about Pablo Picasso on Day 1 of art class?</p>

<p>Shouldnâ€™t they be spending more time drawing exactly what they want to draw? Shouldnâ€™t constructive criticism be made about the drawings they want to draw rather than shoving pastels and Van Goghâ€™s Starry Night down their throat?</p>

<p>I couldnâ€™t think of a quicker way to get that kid completely uninterested in art. Skip the watercolors, skip the pastels, give that kid some pencils and markers and let him draw superheroes.</p>

<p>If you want to get crazy, give him a ruler and suggest creating a few comic panels.</p>

<p>So why are we trying to get the 8 year old to see the beauty of Georgia Oâ€™Keeffeâ€™s cow skulls?</p>

<p>But waitâ€¦</p>

<p><em>They need to study the greats! There are so many lessons to be learned from them!</em></p>

<p>No shit. Iâ€™m not saying those lessons should be ignored. Iâ€™m saying those lessons need to be taught in the <em>right way</em> at the <em>right time</em>.</p>

<p>I heard Ben Shapiro talking about religious stories that forever changed my perspective on them. He said you canâ€™t teach kids values. They mentally check out.</p>

<p>Instead, you have to tell them an interesting story and slide the values in. Without the story to pull them in, theyâ€™ll never want to hear the values.</p>

<p>Whether you agree with those values or not, itâ€™s hard to argue against the stories when theyâ€™re still be talked about thousands of years later.</p>

<p>Art needs a similar approach.</p>

<p>Let the kid draw Iron Man in front of a mountain. Eventually heâ€™ll realize his Iron Man in front of a mountain doesnâ€™t look as good as the comic book artists he admires. A bit of frustration and theyâ€™ll wonder why.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s where the art teacher comes in to teach them about perspective, horizon lines, and vanishing points.</p>

<p>On Day 1, that lecture will put most kids and adults to sleep.</p>

<p>On Day Why-Doesnâ€™t-Mine-Look-As-Good-As-Theirs, thatâ€™s an epiphany.</p>

<p>On Day 1, most kids learn about values and lighting by drawing some stupid sphere or apple.</p>

<p>Why not introduce these concepts on Day Why-Doesnâ€™t-Mine-Look-As-Good-As-Theirs instead?</p>

<p>On that day, you have the kids full attention. Youâ€™re adding to their art and showing the transformation that takes it from â€œgoodâ€ to â€œwhoa!â€.</p>

<p>Itâ€™ll be the biggest WTF moment since they started art.</p>

<p>On Day 1, every kid is spaced out. Nobody is paying attention. The kids who <em>really</em> canâ€™t pay attention may even be sent to the nurse, diagnosed with ADHD, and put on Ritalin.</p>

<p>But most teachers have the mindset of the shitty standup comic: Itâ€™s not my jokes that suck, itâ€™s the audience.</p>

<p>When the entire audience isnâ€™t laughing it might be time to rethink your delivery.</p>
