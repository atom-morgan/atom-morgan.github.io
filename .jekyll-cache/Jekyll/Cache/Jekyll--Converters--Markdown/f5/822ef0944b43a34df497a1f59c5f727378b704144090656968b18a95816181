I"Ú	<p>I started a podcast. Iâ€™ve wanted to start my own for a long time but as usual I tend to sit on an idea for a long time before I finally act on it. Sometimes I think this is a bad trait but I wonder if it serves as a mechanism for me to internally test my level of commitment before jumping in.</p>

<p>When I was in college I had an English teacher who had us write a one page paper every week that weâ€™d read out loud to our classmates. After a few weeks I found the assignment to be extremely enjoyable. Eventually Iâ€™d show up to class with multiple papers and decide which one Iâ€™d read right before it was my turn. I had a lot of stuff to say but I couldnâ€™t decide what I wanted to share. Iâ€™m not 100% sure because I never actually asked my classmates but I think I was one of the more entertaining writers/speakers of the bunch.</p>

<p>I remember finishing that class and feeling a little lost. I developed a habit of writing and speaking and I was starting to enjoy it. If I couldnâ€™t be in his class every week I decided to start writing on my own. I started a blog on Tumblr and published my thoughts to the world. Other than actually writing the blog posts and hitting publish, I didnâ€™t put any effort into it at all. I tried, somewhat, to keep it anonymous. I didnâ€™t share my posts on Facebook or Twitter and I didnâ€™t talk about it with my friends.</p>

<p>Eventually it started to gain some traction. It had a bigger following than every other social network I was using and I didnâ€™t actively try to build a following. I simply published content I thought was enjoyable, thought-provoking, and entertaining for others to decide. With patience and persistence it was eventually an accidental success.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I started to lose interest in the blog and the platform after some time and I recently deleted it. Now, just like in college, Iâ€™m at a point where I want to continue sharing my thoughts. Programming as a career isnâ€™t the fairy tale tech tries to sell you. Millennials are fucked in a lot of ways. The economy and higher education are in a horrible state where most people my age are tens of thousands in debt with a piece of paper that gets them nothing. But I donâ€™t like writing enough just to do that.</p>

<p>A podcast it is, then. If you like my writing, tweets, or youâ€™re curious about my thoughts on current events, politics, and technology you can find my podcast <a href="http://goo.gl/xzalp1" target="_blank">The Adam Morgan Show</a> on iTunes.</p>
