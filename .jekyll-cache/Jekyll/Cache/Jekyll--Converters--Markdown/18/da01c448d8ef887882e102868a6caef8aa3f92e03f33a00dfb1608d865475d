<p>Shortly after Angularâ€™s release, I took time off day-to-day work to focus on writing a book.</p>

<p>I self-published a 500+ page book teaching the Angular framework and automated testing. The book teaches how to create, develop, test, and deploy Angular applications using the Angular CLI, Jasmine, and Cypress.</p>

<p>It is currently the highest rated book on Amazon covering Angular and automated testing and the feedback from readers has been very positive.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in learning more about Angular, automated testing, or hiring me for Angular workshops, feel free to contact me via email at <a href="mailto:atom.morgan@gmail.com" target="_blank">atom.morgan@gmail.com</a> or <a href="https://calendly.com/atom-morgan" target="_blank">click here</a> to set up a call.</p>
