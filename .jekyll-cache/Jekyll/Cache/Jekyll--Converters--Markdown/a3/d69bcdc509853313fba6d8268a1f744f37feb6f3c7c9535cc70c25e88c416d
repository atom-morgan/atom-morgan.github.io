I"Å<p>I stumbled upon an article the other day that contained a small piece of information Iâ€™d never known before. To be an investor, you have to be <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/sec-announces-crowdfunding-rule-to-allow-startups-to-raise-1-million-from-unaccredited-investors-2013-10#ixzz2iaskUpYm" target="_blank">accredited</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Private companies are currently allowed to solicit only accredited investors - those with a net worth of at least $1 million, excluding the value of their homes, or annual income of more than $200,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One million dollars. That seems like a high requirement in todayâ€™s world where businesses can literally be started by a couple of students living in a dorm room.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve never invested money into a company and I definitely donâ€™t have enough cash to throw around at a few small startups, but in the early stages companies can get by with very little capital. Just recently in Atlanta, a new <a href="http://davidcummings.org/2013/09/27/announcing-the-atlanta-student-fund/" target="_blank">fund</a> has been created specifically for students at Georgia Tech. Investments range from $5,000 to $10,000.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s still no small sum of money for a recent college graduate like myself, but itâ€™s manageable for someone in my situation. And to be perfectly honest, itâ€™s even an amount I would seriously consider investing if I saw enough potential in the founders and their business.</p>

<p>However, even if the crowdfunding proposal is passed, â€œunaccreditedâ€ investors will be extremely limited in the amount they can legally contribute.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The proposal says that investors with a net worth and income of less than $100,000 can contribute only $2,000 or 5 percent of their net worth or income, whichever is greater.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldnâ€™t be able to provide the experience and knowledge of more seasoned investors, but itâ€™s cash and it diverts attention away from fundraising and towards building a business. Itâ€™s cash Iâ€™m willing to risk today with the potential for a greater return tomorrow.</p>

<p>All of this leaves one burning question on my mind. Why do investors need to be accredited?</p>
