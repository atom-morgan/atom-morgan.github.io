I"¦<p>I started my career in marketing consulting working with a variety of Fortune 500 companies. My main focus was data analysis but after coding a few internal tools I eventually decided to quit my job and enter the tech industry.</p>

<p>Since then I spend most of my time working with JavaScript/TypeScript and MEAN stacks. Iâ€™ve worked in a variety of environments ranging from Fortune 500 companies to startups and creative agencies. Across these companies, Iâ€™ve taken various roles ranging from full-stack development to UI design and UX research.</p>
