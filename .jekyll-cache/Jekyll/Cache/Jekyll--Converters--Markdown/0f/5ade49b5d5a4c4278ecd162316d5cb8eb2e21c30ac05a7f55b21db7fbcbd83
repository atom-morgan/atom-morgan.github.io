<p>I was the sole developer building an internal video conferencing application to allow startup entrepreneurs to remotely pitch investors. Application features I built include live video streaming, screen sharing, real-time chat, along with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extensions.</p>

<p>I was also responsible for refactoring an entire AngularJS application towards a component-based architecture along with their internal CSS framework by isolating styles to components or pages, removing all unnecessary inline styles, and leveraging many other UI best practices.</p>

<p>Along with my development work, I also designed new features including an investment summary for limited partners, document management systems, and an entrepreneur portal.</p>
