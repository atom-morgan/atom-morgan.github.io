I"ö<p>Roughly two months ago, Snapchat released their â€œOur Storyâ€ feature. Similar to the â€œMy Storyâ€ feature available to all users of the app, the â€œOur Storyâ€ feature provides the ability for a curated channel of snaps by Snapchat users thatâ€™s accessible to everyone. Its debut was at the Electric Daisy Carnival, a dance music festival with roughly 140,000 people in attendance.</p>

<p>Once I added the EDC Live account to my friends list, I was hooked. I had a first person view of the event from a variety of perspectives that I would find myself watching in short bursts throughout my day. Roughly a month later, they created another channel for the World Cup that was just as enjoyable.</p>

<p>These two events may have been a great debut for the feature but I think itâ€™s time to see this feature applied to a variety of events.</p>

<p>There was an â€œOur Storyâ€ for EDC. Why not Ferguson?</p>

<p>Twitter has completely changed the way I consume news. Once I heard enough people mention the shooting of Michael Brown, I went to Twitter and searched #ferguson. That may not have made sense ten years ago, but thatâ€™s how many people consume news today. When something happens they go to Twitter and within a hashtag they can search through numerous tweets, articles, videos, and photos all related to that event.</p>

<p>Imagine that potential on Snapchat. An â€œOur Storyâ€ for Ferguson would give us ground level perspectives that weâ€™d never see on cable news. Weâ€™d hear statements from people living the event firsthand. We would have the ability to see a town react as the National Guard moved in.</p>

<p>Twitter helped organize a revolution in Egypt through a hashtag - #Jan25th. I really hope Snapchat goes along for the ride in the future.</p>
